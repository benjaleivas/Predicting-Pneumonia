        df (pandas df): pandas dataframe

        img_dir_path: directory path to your images
        transform: Compose (a PyTorch Class) that strings together several
          transform functions (e.g. data augmentation steps)

        One thing to note -- you technically could implement `transform` within
        the dataset. No one is going to stop you, but you can think of the
        transformations/augmentations you do as a hyperparameter. If you treat
        it as a hyperparameter, you want to be able to experiment with different
        transformations, and therefore, it would make more sense to decide those
        transformations outside the dataset class and pass it to the dataset!
