    "    \"A major type of sample variation was related to image collection, reflected by image darkness, contrast, size, orientation, (Figure 1A) etc. In addition, some images contained unexpected nonhuman structures such as image labeling, pen marks, pictures of medical treatment devices, (Figure 1B) etc. We realized that we need to build our AI models capable of identifying and excluding those non-pneumonia variations when reading chest X-ray images. It is equally important that our AI models should have abilities to distinguish Covid-19 pneumonia from non-Covid-19 pneumonia caused by viruses or bacteria.\"\n",

    "        rescale —Each digital image is created by a pixel with a value between 0 and 255. 0 in black, 255 in white. So rescale the scales array of the original image pixel values to be between [0,1] which makes the images contribute more equally to the overall loss. Otherwise, higher pixel range image results in greater loss and a lower learning rate should be used, lower pixel range image would require a higher learning rate.\n",
